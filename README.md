# Cloth Simulation
## Description

Our project focuses on enhancing interactivity within Unity by integrating dynamic cloth simulations using a mass-spring model. 
By incorporating this feature, developers can create immersive experiences where cloth objects react realistically to user interactions or changes in the virtual environment.

## Features

* Dynamic Cloth Integration: Integrate dynamic cloth simulations into Unity projects, allowing cloth objects to exhibit realistic behavior such as stretching, folding, and draping.

* Real-time Response: Ensure that cloth objects respond dynamically to user actions, such as collisions, forces, or user-controlled movements.

* Customizable Settings: Provide developers with options to adjust parameters such as cloth stiffness, elasticity, and friction to achieve the desired simulation behavior.

# Cloth Simulation
## Description

Our project focuses on enhancing interactivity within Unity by integrating dynamic cloth simulations using a mass-spring model. 
By incorporating this feature, developers can create immersive experiences where cloth objects react realistically to user interactions or changes in the virtual environment.

## Features

* Dynamic Cloth Integration: Integrate dynamic cloth simulations into Unity projects, allowing cloth objects to exhibit realistic behavior such as stretching, folding, and draping.

* Real-time Response: Ensure that cloth objects respond dynamically to user actions, such as collisions, forces, or user-controlled movements.

* Customizable Settings: Provide developers with options to adjust parameters such as cloth stiffness, elasticity, and friction to achieve the desired simulation behavior.

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository:
   
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   
cd your-project

5. Open the Unity Project:

Once you've navigated to the project directory, you can open the Unity project by following these steps:

Launch the Unity Hub application (if you haven't installed it yet, download and install it from the Unity website).

In Unity Hub, click on the "Projects" tab.

Click on the "Add" button and navigate to the directory where you cloned the project.

Select the project folder (the one containing the Assets, ProjectSettings, etc. directories) and click "Select Folder".

The project will now appear in your Unity Hub projects list. Click on it to open it in the Unity Editor.

## Technologies Used

* Unity version: 2022.3.10f1
